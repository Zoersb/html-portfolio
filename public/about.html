<p>Hi I'm Zoe Blackburn and I am currently on my way to becoming a software engineer. I am 18 and just out of high 
  school and really took a liking to my dads work, software engineering. I am really excited to start learning 
  to code and to start being able to understand everuthing there is to know about coding. Although coding is what I am making 
  this website for, I have more that I want to share about myself than just that.</p>

<p> I have 3 siblings and am a twin but the oldest of 2 younger siblings. Some of the hobbies that I enjoy 
  include video games, crocheting, reading, and drawing. Although this is what I like to do in my free time, I have 
  a job at the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Cinemark+Century+Huntington+Beach+and+XD/@33.7326894,-117

<p>I currently have a long distance <b><i>boyfriend</i></b> from South Carolina named Luke that I've been dating 
  for a year and a half. We visit each other every couple of months when we are able to and usually for a week 
  or two at a time. The first time I ever met him in person was July 4th of 2023. Our next meeting was December 
  26th of 2023. Then our most recent trip seeing each other was on April 26th of 2024 where he came out to California 
  to take me to prom. We currently have a trip planned for me to go out to South Carolina on August 3rd of 2024. 
  On this upcoming trip his family planned for all of us to go up to Tennessee and I am very excited for that.</p>
